# Nodes format:
# Node number (1 - 254): used as part of IP address generation
#   hostname: used for config generation, no spaces or special characters
#   platform: corresponds to platform_definitions.yaml file
#   site: range 1 - 254, used as part of loopback IP address generation
#   neighbors: specify up to 10 neighbors by node number (platform dependent)
#     NOTE: Some platforms (like XRv9k) only support up to 7 neighbors based
#           on ESXi vNIC limitation
#     NOTE: Even if you only have a single neighbor, you must still put it
#           in brackets
